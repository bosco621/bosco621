👋 Hello, fellow developers! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

👨‍💻 I'm <b>@bosco621</b>, a coding enthusiast who loves to explore different programming languages and technologies for fun. I have experience in VBA, Python, C++, and I enjoy tackling coding challenges and building projects that expand my knowledge and skills.

🤖 I have a particular interest in machine learning and its applications. I find the field fascinating and love to dive into projects that involve data analysis, predictive modeling, and neural networks. I am constantly learning and staying updated with the latest advancements in this exciting domain.

⚽️ When I'm not coding, you can find me glued to a football match. I'm an avid sports enthusiast and enjoy watching football, with Lionel Messi being my all-time favorite player. I support <font style="color:deeppink;">FC Barcelona</font> and the Argentina national team, and I get thrilled by their performances on the field.

🏀 Besides football, I also actively participate in sports. Basketball and lacrosse are my go-to sports for staying active and engaging in friendly competition. There's nothing quite like the rush of adrenaline on the court or field.

✈️ I have a passion for traveling and exploring new cultures. I've been fortunate enough to visit several countries, including Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Sweden, Morocco, Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, and Andorra. Each destination has left a lasting impression, and I cherish the experiences and memories I've gained from these adventures.

🏙️ Among all the cities I've visited, Barcelona holds a special place in my heart. Its vibrant atmosphere, stunning architecture, and rich history captivate me every time I set foot in the city.

🌍 Join me on my coding journey and let's explore the world of technology together. Feel free to connect, collaborate, and share ideas. Happy coding!
