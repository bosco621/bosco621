👋 Hello, fellow developers! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

👨‍💻 I'm <b>@bosco621</b>, a coding enthusiast who loves to explore different programming languages and technologies for fun. I have experience in VBA, Python, C++, and I enjoy tackling coding challenges and building projects that expand my knowledge and skills.

⚽️ When I'm not coding, you can find me glued to a football match. I'm an avid sports enthusiast and enjoy watching football, with Lionel Messi being my all-time favorite player. I support ${\textsf{\color{#004D98}FC Barcelona}}$ and the ${\textsf{\color{#75AADB}Argentina national team}}$, and I get thrilled by their performances on the field.

🏃🏻 Besides football, I also actively participate in sports. Basketball🏀 and Lacrosse🥍 are my go-to sports for staying active and engaging in friendly competition. There's nothing quite like the rush of adrenaline on the court or field.

✈️ I have a passion for traveling and exploring new cultures. I've been to 🇹🇼 🇹🇭 🇯🇵 🇪🇸 🇵🇹 🇫🇷 🇩🇪 🇸🇪 🇲🇦 🇨🇿 🇦🇹 🇭🇺 🇦🇩. Each destination has left a lasting impression, and I cherish the experiences and memories I've gained from these adventures.

🏙️ Among all the cities I've visited, Barcelona holds a special place in my heart. Its vibrant atmosphere, stunning architecture, and rich history captivate me every time I set foot in the city.

🌍 Join me on my coding journey and let's explore the world of technology together. Feel free to connect, collaborate, and share ideas. Happy coding!
